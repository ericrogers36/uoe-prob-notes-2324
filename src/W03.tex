\section{More discrete and continuous distributions}

\subsection{Geometric Distribution}
\textbf{Motivating Problem:} I have a process which, independently I execute it, has a probability $p$ of success. Let $X$ be the number of tries up to and including my first success. What is the probability that $\PP(X=k)$, i.e.\ I succeed for the first time on my $k$-th try. 

Setting $q=1-p$, to succeed on the $k$-th attempt, I have to fail $k-1$ times in a row and then succeed. Since the tries are all independent, we have 
 \[
         \PP(X=k) = q^{k-1} p. 
  \] 
\begin{defn}[\textbf{Geometric Distribition}]
We call a random variable $X$ geometrically distributed to the parameter $p \in (0,1)$ if
\[ \PP(X=k)= (1-p)^{k-1}p, \quad \text{for all } k \in \{ 1,2,\ldots \}.\]
In this case we write $X \sim Geom(p)$.
\end{defn}
\subsection{Continuous Distributions}

\subsection{Exponential Distribution}

\subsection{Poisson Distribution}

\subsection{Exercises and Problems}
\begin{exer} 
One day each week I go fishing in a lake and  I independently have a probability of $1/52$ of catching the big carp that lives there.
Let $X=k$ if I first catch the carp on my $k$-th day fishing. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item On which day of fishing am I most likely to catch the carp? 
    \item What is the probability that I first catch the carp on my third day fishing? 
    \item What is the expected number of fishing days until I catch the carp? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{exer}
